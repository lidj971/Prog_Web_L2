    <h2><u>Chapitre 1</u> : Mise en page HTML</h2>
    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <br><mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown
        printer took a <i>galley of type</i> and scrambled it to <br>make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also <br>the leap into <u>electronic typesetting</u>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <br>popularised in
        the <i>1960s</i> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem<br> Ipsum passages, and more recently with
        desktop publishing software like<br> Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
